# What is the Command Center?

That first open tab in your browser is a gateway to a multitude of websites.  The paths to each of these websites are varied: some require navigating the bookmarks menu, others require typing enough text that the browser can autcomplete the address, and some you just have to search for.  Command Center is just a way to collect those websites into easily clickable links, streamlining the web surfing process.

**Current Version:** While eventually Command Center will be able to auto-populate its links for your convenience, this is an early build and the links are all hard-coded to things that are relevant to me.

## How does it work?

> Chrome

Command Center currently only works in conjunction with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna">New Tab Redirect</a> extension for Chrome.

> Firefox

You can set Command Center as your home page in the settings menu, but you only have this option for new windows.

> Safari

The settings menu should allow you to set both new windows and new tabs to open Command Center by default.

## What features are planned for Command Center?

Eventually I'd like a to-do list widget that's editable in real time and preserves modifications even when reloading the page.

## License

Command Center uses the MIT license.
